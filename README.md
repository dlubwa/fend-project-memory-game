# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

To play the memory game, open the index.html file and click on two cards to open them. If they have the same symbol that will result in a match and the cards will stay open. If they have different symbols then the cards will only stay open for 800ms to allow you hopefully memorize their location before they flip over to hide their symbols again. A move counter will increment for every move and a timer will start immediately after the first move and end whenever you complete the game successfully. The game ends when you have matched all cards on the deck. You may choose to replay the game and/or reset the game at anytime.

I used sweet alert library to display a modal alert at the end of the game. I Referenced this useful library using a link to a CDN 

## Current issues

A player can click more than two cards if they click very quickly. I am still brainstorming how to fix this bug but otherwise everything should work ok functionally.

The CSS styling is not yet complete. This is still a work in progress as well but should not affect the game's functionality.
